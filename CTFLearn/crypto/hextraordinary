Here, we get a hint in the prompt: the coder's name is ROXy.

After some googling, I stumbled across this tool: http://www.xor.pw/#
Which caught my eye because this is ROXy spelled backwords with the 'y' stripped. I threw in the 2 hexadecimal values that we're given: 0xc4115 0x4cf8

Read more in-depth on what XOR (Exclusive Or) is and how it's calculated here:

I was able to get the flag needed from both the XOR calculator I linked previously, as well as 'printf':

$printf '%#x\n' "$(( 0xc4115 ^ 0x4cf8 ))"
